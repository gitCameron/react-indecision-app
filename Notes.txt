Props vs State (<MyComponent />)

Similarities:
- both are objects
- both can be used when rendering the component
- changes to both cause re-renders

Differences:
- Props comes from above whether it's from a parent component or some jsx that gets passed down from ReactDOM.rendering
- State is defined in the component itself
- Props cannot be changed by the component itself
- State can be changed by the component itself


If you need some more advanced features and need to use state then use a class based component.
If you find yourself creating a class with just a render method then it is probably best to convert it to a stateless component.

componentDidMount() - it is invoked immediately after a component is mounted or inserted into the tree.  

componentDidUpdate() -  is invoked immediately after updating occurs.  This is a good place to do network requests as long as you compare the 
current props to previous props.

componentWillUnmount() - invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. Perform any necessary cleanup in this method, 
such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up any subscriptions
