Props vs State (<MyComponent />)

Similarities:
- both are objects
- both can be used when rendering the component
- changes to both cause re-renders

Differences:
- Props comes from above whether it's from a parent component or some jsx that gets passed down from ReactDOM.rendering
- State is defined in the component itself
- Props cannot be changed by the component itself
- State can be changed by the component itself
